of a simple operation, capable of shooting the stable operation 
of casual games. Firstly on the Android and libgdx were briefly, 
describes the key techniques of libgdx game development framework, 
and then analyzes the sky game overall framework and core modules. 
The game using libgdx engine can achieve cross platform operation, 
in the design by multiple pictures rolling cycle in order to achieve 
the purpose of incoming aircraft, through the screen to achieve missile 
launch control car move around to achieve to circumvent the emitting 
direction of the bomb and missile control by libgdx package the box2d 
physics engine to achieve realistic missile hit the aircraft explosion 
effect by using libgdx in preference to store the gameplay and game 
achievement. Finally according to the design scheme, design and development 
of a stable, smooth, easy to get started shooting game, and be able to
